# heart_disease_prediction_system
my machine learning project on heart disease prediction system
# overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a dataset containing various health parameters and heart disease status to train and evaluate predictive models.
# Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle. . The data preprocessing steps are detailed in the project.ipynb notebook.

# Models
We have implemented and compared the performance of several machine learning models including:

Logistic Regression
You can find the implementation of these models in the project.ipynb notebook.
